# Survival Analysis in R
## Key packages and functions
### Package: Survival
### Functions:

### 1. "survfit"
Fits a simple survival model. This is the function used to create survival curves in R based on the Kaplan-Meier estimator. It estimates the Kaplan-Meier survival curves for the given data. 

For example:


```
km_fit <- survfit(Surv(fu_time, death) ~ 1)
```

Surv(fu_time, death) defines the survival object for the analysis. The Surv function is used to specify the time-to-event data, where fu_time represents the follow-up time and death represents the event indicator (1 if an event occurred, 0 if censored). ~ 1 is the formula specification for the survival analysis. Tilde (~) separates the response variable (Surv(fu_time, death)) from the explanatory variable. In this case, 1 indicates that there are no explanatory variables, meaning we are interested in estimating the overall survival curve without considering any specific grouping factors.

Plotting km_fit will show show the survival curve:

km_fit also contains the survival probabilities at different time points, and other relevant information such as the number at risk and the number of events at each time point. km-fit can be used to plot the survival curve or perform further analyses on the survival data. 

### 2. "surv" 
Produces the KM estimates of the probability of survival over time

For instance, we want to extract the survival probabilities from km_fit object generated by the survfit function. We use the 'summary' function in R. 

```
km_summary <- summary(km_fit)
surv_prob <- km_summary$surv
```

The resulting km_summary object contains various components, including the survival probabilities stored in the surv component. By assigning km_summary$surv to the variable surv_prob, you extract the survival probabilities as a vector. You can use the surv_prob variable to access and analyze the survival probabilities at different time points obtained from the Kaplan-Meier analysis.

### 3. "survdiff" 
Compares the survival curves of 2 groups using the log rank test. It calculates the test statistic and p-value for comparing survival curves. For example, the survival curves of two groups based on gender are compared. 

```
survdiff(Surv(fu_time, death) ~ gender, rho=0)
```

THe chi-squared test statistic measures the discrepancy between the observed data and the expected data under the null hypothesis. The chi-squared statistic of 0.1 with 1 degree of freedom and a p-value of 0.8 indicates that the observed differences in the data are likely due to chance or random variation. There is weak evidence to suggest a significant difference between the groups being compared based on the chi-squared test results.
